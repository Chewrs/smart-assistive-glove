# Prototype 2: Distance Detection with MicroPython + Raspberry Pi Logging (WIP)

## üéØ Goal
Build on Prototype 1 by switching to MicroPython on ESP32, adding logging functionality via Flask on Raspberry Pi, and preparing to use a 3-pin buzzer for audio feedback.

## üß∞ Components Used
- ESP32 (MicroPython)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- 3-pin Buzzer (planned)
- Raspberry Pi 400(Flask server for logging)
- Wi-Fi network connection

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Current & Planned)
- ‚úÖ ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi on boot
- ‚úÖ Reads distance from HC-SR04 (range: **2 cm ‚Äì 300 cm**)
- ‚úÖ Sends data via HTTP POST to Flask server on Raspberry Pi
- ‚úÖ Raspberry Pi currently prints received data to console
- ‚è≥ Improve and clean up ESP32 code structure
- ‚è≥ Store logs or visualize data on the Raspberry Pi
- ‚è≥ Add buzzer feedback based on distance

## ‚úÖ Status
- Wi-Fi setup on ESP32 successful  
- Sensor data reliably sent to Flask server  
- Flask server prints data as expected  
- System foundation ready for future improvements  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Flask server currently does not store or analyze data  
- ESP32 code needs refactoring for readability and modularity  
- Buzzer not connected yet; sound feedback logic still pending
